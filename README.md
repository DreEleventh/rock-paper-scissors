# rock-paper-scissors

Introduction**
Write a program to allow registered users to log in before they can do the Quiz. To log in, a user must
correctly enter their UserID (string) and password (string). The user only get three (3) tries to enter their data correctly. After 3-failed attempts they are shut out of the system and your program will exit.



**Break Down:** 

1. Registration: Allow via a user registration window.

   ​	The users should be presented with a UserName and PassWord fields. 

   ​	The program should then save the users credentials 

2. Login: Allow the user to login via a login page.

   ​	The user only gets three(3) attempts to enter their credentials. 

   ​	The program should check if the credentials entered match any credentials saved. Print an error message if the credentials are incorrect.

   ​	The program should keep track of login attempts. 

   ​	After 3 failed login attempts the user is shutout of the program and the program should then close. 

   

Project
Create a rock­-paper­-scissors style application that has **three (3) menu options File, Rules and Restart.** Your program should have **three pictures change depending on what object is selected**. You do not have to use rock­-paper-­scissor pictures, but clearly state on the system which object beats which. **Have a counter keep track of your total wins, losses, and ties.** 

**Use a radio button for the user selection.** Use **a standard button to submit the user choice**. **Display both user and the computer selection after the submit button has been clicked.** **Clearly identify who won the match.** You must somewhere identify which object beats which (If different from the traditional Rock­Paper­Scissors).

Additions Program **must include a counter to keep track of the total wins, losses, and ties.** **The program should prevent continuing play when the user has 10 losses or wins.**



**Break Down:**

1. The program should incorporate a main menu with the following options. 

   - Rules - Displays the rules of the game 

   - Restart - Restarts the game for a particular user 

2. The program should incorporate 3 pictures that represent Rook, Paper, and Scissors. These pictures should change depending on the object selected. 
3. The program should keep track of the total wins, losses, and ties. 
4. Radio buttons for selection and standard buttons for submission. 
5. Display both user and computer selection after clicking the submit button.
6. Display clearly who won a match. 
7. The program should prevent continuing play when the user has 10 losses or wins.
